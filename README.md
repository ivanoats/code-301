# Introduction

We are going to learn about many different topics of web development. The overall structure is based on Model-View-Controller (MVC), which is a common design pattern for web applications.

The general course schedule is:

Full Time  | Part Time    | Topic
-----------|--------------|---------------
Week 1     | Week 1 and 2 | The Model
Week 2     | Week 3 and 4 | The View
Week 3     | Week 5 and 6 | The Controller
Week 4     | Week 7 and 8 | Your Project

## Exercises

Each class will have exercises for lab and homework. You can find these in the exercises in each chapter subdirectory.

For students, make a subfodler within the exercises folder and submit your homework with a Pull Request

## Building This Project Locally

This course project is a gitbook. This allows it to be read on Github, published to a web server, or PDF, EPUB and MOBI.

To read and edit the gitbook on your own machine, after cloning this repo, execute these commands in Terminal:
```
npm -g install gitbook-cli
gitbook serve
```

## Slideshows

Slides should be placed in each chapter's subdirectory

To run the RemarkJS slideshows, use live-server or something similar, e.g.:

```
npm -g install live-server
live-server chapter1-persistence
```

Keynote, Keynote HTML exports, PPT, PPT HTML exports, and PDF slides can also be put in the directories.
