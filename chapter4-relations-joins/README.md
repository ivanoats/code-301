## Relational Data

Complex data is better organized using more than one table. 

In our example above we may want to store more information about each person. We may want to have a list of standard billing rates. We might want each person's billing rate to automatically adjust when we raise prices.

> The relational model of data permits the database designer to create a consistent, logical representation of information. Consistency is achieved by including declared constraints in the database design, which is usually referred to as the logical schema.
