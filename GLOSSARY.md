# MVC

Model-View-Controller (MVC)  is a software architectural pattern for implementing user interfaces. It divides a given software application into three interconnected parts, so as to separate internal representations of information from the ways that information is presented to or accepted from the user.

Traditionally used for desktop graphical user interfaces, this architecture has become extremely popular for designing web applications.


# Model

A model is the representation of the data in code. It stores data that is retrieved according to commands from the controller and displayed in the view.

# View

A view is how the app looks. It generates HTML, viewable by the user, based on changes in the model.

# Controller

A controller can send commands to the model to update the model's state (e.g., editing a document). It can also send commands to its associated view to change the view's presentation of the model (e.g., by scrolling through a document).
